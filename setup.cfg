# Make sure to change USB_PID if you enable different USB functionality in order
# to force Windows to enumerate the device again
USB_VID="0x1d6b"        # Vendor ID
USB_PID="0x0137"        # Product ID

USE_ECM=true            # if true CDC ECM will be enabled
USE_RNDIS=true          # if true RNDIS will be enabled
USE_HID=false            # if true HID (keyboard) will be enabled
USE_RAWHID=false         # if true a raw HID device will be enabled
USE_RAWHID_FULLDUPLEX=false         # if true two raw HID devices will be enabled (input + output)
USE_UMS=false           # if true USB Mass Storage will be enabled

# Network and DHCP options USB over Ethernet
# ===========================================

# Wether to set the IP via DHCP or from the variabled below
IF_DHCP=false

# We choose an IP with a very small subnet (see comments in README.rst)
IF_IP="172.16.0.1" # IP used by P4wnP1
IF_MASK="255.255.255.252"
IF_DHCP_RANGE="172.16.0.2,172.16.0.2" # DHCP Server IP Range

ROUTE_SPOOF=false # set two static routes on target to cover whole IPv4 range
WPAD_ENTRY=false # provide a WPAD entry via DHCP pointing to responder

# ============================
# WiFi options (only Pi Zero W)
# ============================
WIFI_REG=US # WiFi regulatory domain (if not set accordingly, WiFi channels are missing)

# Access Point Settings
# ---------------------

WIFI_ACCESSPOINT=true
WIFI_ACCESSPOINT_NAME="P4wnP1"

WIFI_ACCESSPOINT_DHCP_RANGE="172.24.0.2,172.24.0.100" # DHCP Server IP Range
WIFI_ACCESSPOINT_HIDE_SSID=false # use to hide SSID of WLAN (you have to manually connect to the name given by WIFI_ACCESSPOINT_NAME)

# WiFi Client Settings
# --------------------

WIFI_CLIENT=false 	# enables connecting to existing WiFi (currently only WPA2 PSK)
			# example payload: wifi_connect.txt
			# Warning: could slow down boot, because:
			#	- scan for target network is issued upfront
			#	- DHCP client is started and waits for a lease on WiFi adapter
			# Note: if WIFI_ACCESSPOINT is enabled, too:
			#	- P4wnP1 tries to connect to the given WiFi
			# 	- if connection fails, the AccessPoint is started instead
WIFI_CLIENT_SSID="Accespoint Name" # name of target network
WIFI_CLIENT_PSK="AccessPoint password" # passphrase for target network
WIFI_CLIENT_STORE_NETWORK=false # unused right now, should be used to store known networks, but priority has to be given if multiple known networks are present
WIFI_CLIENT_OVERWRITE_PSK=true # unused right now, in case the network WIFI_CLIENT_STORE_NETWORK is set an existing PSK gets overwritten

# ==================================
# Keyboard settings for HID keyboard
# ==================================
lang="us" # Keyboard language for outhid and duckhid commands
HID_KEYBOARD_TEST=true # if enabled 'onKeyboardUp' is fired as soon as the host initializes the keyboard

# ===============================================
# Settings for reachback connections with AutoSSH
# ===============================================

AUTOSSH_REMOTE_HOST=YourSSH-server.com # host address of the remote SSH server
AUTOSSH_REMOTE_USER=root # valid user of the remote SSH server (passwordless login has to be possible with the key given by AUTOSSH_PRIVATE_KEY)

AUTOSSH_PUBLIC_KEY="$wdir/ssh/keys/P4wnP1_id.pub" # this key has to be present in ~/.ssh/authorized_keys file of AUTOSSH_REMOTE_USER, (use ./ssh/pushkey.sh to assist)
AUTOSSH_REMOTE_PORT=8765 # P4wnP1's SSH shell will be reachable at this port on the remote SSH server (the port is bound to localhost and thus not exposed to public facing IP)
